!! Don't edit .js files that say "Generated by CoffeeScript" at the top. !!

The `coffee` directory is for CoffeeScript source files. Run compile.sh while
in the `coffee` directory to compile all of the source files. The compiled
.js files will be placed in the `js` directory. If you aren't in `coffee` when
you run compile.sh, it will put the compiled files in the wrong place since it
uses a relative path.

Both .coffee and the compiled .js files should be tracked with git.

Sam recommends writing any new client-side scripts in CoffeeScript instead of
JavaScript. But CoffeeScript can call JavaScript and vice versa, so it's not
a big deal.
