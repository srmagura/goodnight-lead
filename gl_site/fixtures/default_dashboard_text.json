            "<p>LEAD stands for Learn, Evaluate, Assess, and Develop. Effective leaders engage in all of these activities. The lab emphasizes that learning about leadership is experimental. You will make mistakes. However, labs are meant for experimentation to figure out what works. One leadership scholar Dr. Padilla has said that leadership cannot be taught but it can be learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>On Leadership</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leadership is more than the leader. Most professional development focuses on leader development. However, it is just as important to consider followers and the contexts when learning about leadership. The LEAD Lab emphasizes all three parts of the Leadership Triangle.</p>\r\n",
