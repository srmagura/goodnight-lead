Run compile.sh while in the this directory to compile all of the
CoffeeScript source files. The compiled .js files will be placed in
gl_site/static/gl_site/js. If you aren't in gl_site/static_src/coffee when
you run compile.sh, it will put the compiled files in the wrong place since it
uses a relative path.

Both .coffee and the compiled .js files should be tracked with git.
